**ETH Zürich - Teaching Assistant** 

I was a teaching assitant for the class [__Autonomous Mobility on Demand__](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=119019&semkez=2017W&lang=en) which is part of the [__Duckietown project__](https://www.duckietown.org/). I supervised a group of students develop a Python module for lane following from computer vision.
