The second major project of my PhD was to develop novel methods in inertial estimation using deep learning. The following papers are related to this project:

- Russell Buchanan, Marco Camurri, Frank Dellaert, and Maurice Fallon, “Learning inertial odometry for dynamic legged robot state estimation,” in Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), vol. 164, 2022, pp. 1575–1584.
- Russell Buchanan, Varun Agrawal, Marco Camurri, Frank Dellaert, and Maurice Fallon “Deep IMU Bias Inference for Robust Visual-Inertial Odometry with Factor Graphs,” in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. 2022
