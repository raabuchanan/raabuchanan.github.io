My with robotics began with [McGill Robotics](https://www.mcgillrobotics.com). I was a founding member of the team in 2014 and remain heavily involved throuough my undergraduate degree. In 2016 I became leader of the underwater robotics team and lead 70 of my fellow students in designing and building an autonomous underwater vehicle. We competed at the AUVSI [RoboSub](https://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub) competition and reached the finals, placing 7th out of 50 international teams. You can read the full technical report [here](https://raabuchanan.com/files/RoboSub2016.pdf).

In the figure above, our robot uses the forward facing camera and visual servoing to bump into the underwater buoy, scoring our team points.
