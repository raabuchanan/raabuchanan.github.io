The first major project of my PhD was to develop methods in haptic localisation for legged robotics. This was in contribution to the EU H2020 Project [subTerranean Haptic INvestiGator Project](http://thing-h2020.eu/). The following papers are related to this project:

- Russell Buchanan, Marco Camurri, and Maurice Fallon, “Haptic Sequential Monte Carlo Localization for Quadrupedal Locomotion in Vision-Denied Scenarios,” in IEEE/RSJ Intl. Conf. on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2020.
- Russell Buchanan, Jakub Bednarek, Marco Camurri, Michal Nowicki, Krzysztof Walas, Maurice Fallon, “Navigating by Touch: Haptic Sequential Monte Carlo Localization via Geometric Sensing and Terrain Classification,” in Autonomous Robots 2021.
- M. Łysakowski, M. Nowicki, R. Buchanan, M. Camurri,M. Fallon, K. Walas,  "Unsupervised Learning of Terrain Representations for Haptic Monte Carlo Localization" in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2022
