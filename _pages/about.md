I am interested in perception and learning to enable legged robots to be deployed in real-world situations. I have investigated problems such as state estimation, localization, whole-body planning and manipulation for legged robots in a wide range of applications including disaster response, healthcare and industrial inspection. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Edinburgh. I completed my PhD at the University of Oxford in the [Dynamic Robot Systems Lab](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/drs/) with Prof. Maurice Fallon. My thesis was on proprioceptive state estimation and localization for legged robots.

I received my MSc. in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH Zürich.  My Master's thesis was done in collaboration with the [CSIRO Data61 Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/) in Brisbane, Australia. I also worked as a research engineer at the [Robotic Systems Lab](http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/) of ETH Zürich as a member of the winning Team CERBERUS in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.

I received my BEng. Honours in Electrical Engineering in 2016 from McGill University in my home city of Montreal, Canada.
